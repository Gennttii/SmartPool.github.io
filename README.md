Content changes should be made in `index.slim` file. To see how the changes affect the page, we need to compile `index.slim` to `index.html`.

### Install dependency
We assume that you already have Ruby installed in your environment. Install `slim` template engine.

```
gem install slim
```
### Compile the index file
```
sh compile.sh
```
