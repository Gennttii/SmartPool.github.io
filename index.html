              We use Ethereum smart contracts to build a decentralized pooled mining protocol called SmartPool. Our solution implicitly replaces the centralized pool operator by network participants who run the Ethereum network.
            </p>
            <p class="point-body">
              SmartPool includes several novel data structures and design choices which make its protocol secure and efficient. Specifically, we devise a new mechanism to verify and record miners' contributions to the pool without centralized operators. SmartPool's efficient probabilistic verification drastically reduces both the number of messages and the costs to run the pool for miners. Using a novel data structure called the augmented Merkle tree, SmartPool's batched share submission and efficient payment scheme remove any incentive for submitting invalid batches.

                <p class="answer">
                  Normal centralized pools are not ideal because of: centralization in mining (obviously), transaction censorship (e.g. mining empty blocks, black-listing transactions), and high fees.

                <p class="answer">
                  SmartPool enables an efficient way to mine blocks in a decentralized manner between miners. Everyone can propose their own transactions in a block, thus eliminating the censorship on transactions. SmartPool requires negligible to no fees from miners.

                  We are excited about Proof of stake as much as anyone else, but it will take roughly <a href="https://twitter.com/VladZamfir/status/814907702833016833">one more year</a> for PoS to come.

                  We feel that having a separate token or currency associated with it may ultimately limit its adoption. SmartPool's goal is decentralization, and the best way to get there is to scale without creating auxiliary incentive structures around it.

                  The SmartPool project is funded by the community and run by the community. Thus, we will do a crowdfund and ask for donations from the public. We are also applying for some dev grants like Ethereum Dev Grants or Wanxiang Blockchain Labs. We will keep updating our funding status.

                  There is no financial benefit at the moment. Although we issue tokens for each donation, the tokens are only to represent contributions to SmartPool. Our first priority is to promote decentralized mining and have a running pool with significant hash power. Compensating token holders will be considered, but will not be our main focus.
